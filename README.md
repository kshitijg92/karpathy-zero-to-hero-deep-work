# Building deep understanding of Neural Networks

The deep implementation work **Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero neural network series** — arguably the best free resource for going from zero to a genuine understanding of how modern deep learning works. Karpathy is a rare force in this field: someone at the frontier of AI research who also cares deeply about making that knowledge accessible to everyone. That he releases material of this quality for free is something worth being genuinely grateful for.

## How I'm Learning

### How to Watch

Every video gets **two passes**:

- **First pass:** Watch straight through. No notes, no pausing. Build the mental scaffold.
- **Second pass:** Notebook + Jupyter open. Pause constantly. Write concepts in my own words. Type all code yourself. Break things. Try things.

The second pass is currently taking me 6x longer than the video. That's the point.

### How I Build the Notebooks

**Every line of code is typed by hand.** No copy-pasting from the video or the repo. The friction of typing forces you to actually think about what each line does — and the bugs you inevitably introduce teach you more than the correct code would.

The notebooks are also built to read like explanations — as if I were teaching the material to someone else. This isn't just a documentation choice; it's a learning strategy. The act of explaining something clearly forces you to find the gaps in your own understanding and fill them. If I can't write a precise explanation of why something works, I don't actually understand it yet.

## A Note on AI Usage

I used Claude (Anthropic) as a learning aid while working through this material — but with a clear boundary: **all code was written by me, by hand**. No code was generated by AI.

Where AI helped was in the notebooks themselves — expanding explanations, adding historical context, sharpening imprecise descriptions, and connecting concepts to the broader ML landscape. Think of it as having a knowledgeable study partner to pressure-test your understanding and fill in gaps, not as a shortcut around doing the work.

The goal was always comprehension, not completion.
